## <a name="chapter-1"></a> CHAPTER 1. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

##### General Consideration 1

The progress of prokaryotic microbiology requires a precise system of
nomenclature accepted by the majority of microbiologists. For practical
purposes the term prokaryotes is a synonym for Archaea and Bacteria.

##### General Consideration 2

To achieve order in nomenclature, it is essential that scientific names be
regulated by internationally accepted rules.

##### General Consideration 3

The rules that govern the scientific nomenclature used in the biological
sciences are embodied in international codes of nomenclature.

##### General Consideration 4

Rules of nomenclature do not govern the delimitation of taxa or determine their
relations. The rules are primarily for assessing the correctness of the names
applied to defined taxa; they also prescribe procedures for creating and
proposing new names.

##### General Consideration 5

The Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described from Sequence Data
applies to the naming of all prokaryotes where the lower taxa (species and
subspecies) are typified by a DNA sequence.
This code is colloquially referred to as the SeqCode to distinguish it from the
International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP), which applies to the
naming of all prokaryotes where the lower taxa (species and subspecies) are
typified by either a strain or illustration/description. The nomenclature of
eukaryotic microbial groups is provided for by other Codes: fungi and algae by
the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants; protozoa by
the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The nomenclature of viruses
is provided for by the International Code of Virus Classification and
Nomenclature.

##### General Consideration 6

The Committee on the Systematics of Prokaryotes Described from Sequence Data,
colloquially the SeqCode Committee, has been established to
provide mechanisms to emend, interpret, and consider exemptions to the rules of
the SeqCode.

##### General Consideration 7

The SeqCode is divided into principles, rules and recommendations. The
principles ([Chapter 2](#chapter-2)) form the basis of the Code, and the rules
and recommendations are derived from them. The rules ([Chapter 3](#chapter-3))
are designed to implement the principles. The recommendations
([Chapter 3](#chapter-3)) supplement some of the rules and do not have the force
of rules. They are intended as guides to desirable practice. Names contrary to
recommendations cannot be rejected for this reason. Appendices may be added to
assist in the application of this Code and do not form the legislative part of
this Code.

##### General Consideration 8

Nomenclature deals with the application of names to the following taxonomic
ranks, i.e., “subspecies”, “species”, “genus”, “family”, “order”, “class”,
and “phylum”.

##### General Consideration 9

The SeqCode is an instrument of scientific communication.



## <a name="chapter-2"></a> CHAPTER 2. PRINCIPLES

##### Principle 1

The SeqCode has one fundamental aim, which is to provide a standardized, robust,
and stable system of nomenclature for prokaryotes that is compatible with the
freedom of scientists to classify prokaryotes according to taxonomic opinion.
Nothing in the SeqCode may be construed to restrict the freedom of taxonomic
opinion or action.

##### Principle 2

The nomenclature of prokaryotes is **not independent** of botanical, zoological
and viral nomenclature. When naming new taxa at the rank of genus or higher,
names that are already regulated by the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature, the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants
and the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature must not be
used.

The names formed under the SeqCode are **not independent** of the names
regulated by the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP)
and formed before January 1, 2022.
Before that date, legitimate names formed under the ICNP have priority.
After that date, the rules of priority of the SeqCode are used to determine
priority of names formed under the ICNP compared with names formed under
the SeqCode.

##### Principle 3

The scientific names of all taxa are Latin or Latinized words treated as Latin.

##### Principle 4

The primary purpose of giving a name to a taxon is to supply a means of
referring to it.
A secondary consideration is that names should aid memorability.

##### Principle 5

Names of taxa are tied to their nomenclatural types, referred to as types in the
SeqCode.
Types should serve as a reference point that allow the unambiguous
identification of taxa.

##### Principle 6

The correct name of a taxon is based upon valid publication, legitimacy,
taxonomic position, and priority of publication.

##### Principle 7

A name only has standing in nomenclature if it is validly published under the
rules of the SeqCode.

##### Principle 8

Each taxon with a given circumscription, position, and rank can bear only one
correct name, i.e., the earliest that is in accordance with the rules of the
SeqCode. The circumscription of a taxon is an indication of its limits or the
set of biological entities it contains. The position of a taxon or rank is an
indication of its relationship to a parent taxon within a taxonomy.

##### Principle 9

To promote stability, the name of a taxon should not be changed or replaced
without sufficient reason based on either further taxonomic studies or the need
to rectify a name that is contrary to the rules of SeqCode.

##### Principle 10

Names created should be clear enough to avoid errors, confusion, or
misunderstandings.



## <a name="chapter-3"></a> CHAPTER 3. RULES OF NOMENCLATURE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

### <a name="section-1"></a> Section 1. General

##### Rule 1

The Code on the Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described from
Sequence Data, or SeqCode, will take effect on January 1, 2022.

##### Rule 2

The SeqCode Legislative Commission has been established as the legislative
branch of the SeqCode Committee in accordance with its statutes. The SeqCode
Legislative Commission is the only body authorized to amend the SeqCode.

##### Rule 3

The SeqCode Reconciliation Commission has been established as the judicial
branch of the SeqCode Committee to make decisions pertaining to the application
of the SeqCode in accordance with its statutes. Examples of cases for the
Reconciliation Commission may include: (a) cases in which the consequences or
interpretation of a rule are uncertain, (b) cases in which the application of a
name is likely to endanger health or have serious economic consequences, or (c)
cases where the application of a rule is likely to lead to confusion. When the
opinion of the SeqCode Reconciliation Commission is sought, a summary of
pertinent facts should be submitted to the Reconciliation Commission. The
SeqCode Reconciliation Commission is the only body authorized to render
decisions on the application of the SeqCode.

##### Rule 4

The SeqCode Registry has been established to record and maintain names that are
formed or recognized under the SeqCode in accordance with its statutes.
Registration of names constitutes valid publication and is required for naming
under the SeqCode.

##### Rule 5

The rules of the SeqCode are retroactive except where specified.

##### Rule 6

Names contrary to a rule may not be maintained in the SeqCode Registry.

### <a name="section-2"></a> Section 2. Ranks of Taxa

##### Rule 7a

The taxonomic categories covered by these rules are given below in descending
taxonomic rank.

- Phylum
- Class
- Order
- Family
- Genus
- Species
- Subspecies

##### Rule 7b

The relative order of these categories may not be altered in any classification
even though definitions of taxonomic categories may vary with individual
opinion.

##### Rule 7c

The use of the taxonomic category of subspecies is optional.

##### Rule 7d

Intermediate or informal ranks or categories not mentioned in
[Rule 7a](#rule-7a) are not covered by the SeqCode.

##### Recommendation 7

An author who describes and names a new taxon should indicate the rank of the
taxon and where possible the rank and name of the parent taxon. If the parent
taxon is not currently named, the author should name it.

### <a name="section-3"></a> Section 3. Naming of Taxa

#### General

##### Rule 8

The scientific names of all taxa must be treated as Latin and spelled only with
the Latin alphabet. A species name is a binary combination of a genus name and a
specific epithet; names of taxa above the rank of species are single words.
Typographical signs, numbers, and additional characters cannot be used.

##### Rule 9a

A name at any taxonomic rank can only refer to a single type.

##### Rule 9b

A later homonym of a name formed under the nomenclatural codes listed in
[Principle 2](#principle-2) cannot be used.

##### Recommendation 9

To form new prokaryotic names, authors are advised as follows:

1. Names that are very long or difficult to pronounce should be avoided.
2. Names should differ by at least three characters from existing names of
   genera or species within the same genus.
3. Languages other than Latin should be avoided when Latin equivalents exist or
   can be constructed by combining Latin word elements. Exceptions include names
   derived from local items such as foods, drinks, geographic localities, and
   other names for which no Latin words exist.
4. Authors should not name organisms after themselves. If names are formed from
   personal names, they should contain only the name of one person. They may
   contain the untruncated family and/or first names.
5. All personal genus names should be feminine regardless of the gender identity
   of the person they commemorate.
6. Names should not be deliberately contentious or abusive of any person, gender
   or sexual identity, race, religion, political belief, or ideology.
7. Names that include mnemonic cues are preferred because they promote learning
   and memory.

#### Names of Genera

##### Rule 10

The name of a genus is a noun or adjective used as a noun, in the singular
number and written with an initial capital letter.

##### Recommendation 10

Authors should attend to the following Recommendation and those of
[Recommendation 9](#recommendation-9) when forming genus names.

1. Names that have the same suffixes as those used for the higher taxonomic
   ranks should be avoided: *-aceae*, *-ales*, *-ia*, and *-ota* (see
   [Table 1](#table-1)).

#### Names of Species

##### Rule 11

The name of a species is a binary combination consisting of the name of the
genus followed by a single word known as a species epithet. The genus part of
the name must begin with an initial capital letter, and the species epithet must
begin with a lowercase letter.

##### Rule 12

A species epithet must be related to the genus name in one of three ways.

1. As an adjective. Example: aureus in Staphylococcus aureus.
2. As a substantive (noun) in apposition in the nominative case. Example:
   *Desulfovibrio gigas* or other names cited in
   [Trüper and De’Clari (1997)](#ref-truper-1997).
3. As a noun in the genitive case. Example: *coli* in *Escherichia coli*.

##### Recommendation 12

Authors should attend to the following recommendations and those of
[Recommendation 9](#recommendation-9) when forming species names.

1. When a species epithet is chosen to indicate a property or source of the
   species, epithets should not express a character common to all, or nearly
   all, the species of a genus.
2. When the species epithet is an adjective, it should agree in gender with the
   genus name.

#### Names of Subspecies

##### Rule 13a

The name of a subspecies is a ternary combination consisting of three names:
the genus name, the species epithet, the abbreviation “subsp.” (subspecies),
and the subspecies epithet that begins with a lower-case letter.

##### Rule 13b

A subspecies epithet is formed in the same way as a species epithet.

##### Rule 13c

A subspecies that includes the type of the species must bear the same epithet
as the species.

#### Names of Taxa above the Rank of Genus (Family, Order, Class, Phylum)

##### Rule 14

The name of a taxon above the rank of genus is a Latinized word. Names of
families and orders are in the feminine gender, the plural number, and written
with an initial capital letter. Names of classes and phyla are in the neuter
gender, the plural number, and written with an initial capital letter.

##### Rule 15

The name of a family, order, class, or phylum is formed by the addition of the
appropriate suffix to the stem of the type genus name (see
[Section 4](#section-4)). These suffixes are presented in [Table 1](#table-1).

###### <a name="table-1"></a> Table 1. Suffixes for Taxonomic Ranks

| Rank   | Suffix | Example for the genus *Hadarchaeum* <sup>a</sup>
|--------|--------|-------------------------------------------------
| Phylum | -ota   | *Hadarchaeota*
| Class  | -ia    | *Hadarchaeia*
| Order  | -ales  | *Hadarchaeales*
| Family | -aceae | *Hadarchaeaceae*

<sup>a</sup> From [Chuvochina et al., 2019](#ref-chuvochina-2019)

### <a name="section-4"></a> Section 4. Nomenclatural Types and Their Designation

#### General

##### Rule 16

Each named taxon must have a designated nomenclatural type. The nomenclatural
type, referred to in the SeqCode as “type”, for a species or subspecies is the
evidence for that taxon (DNA sequence, see [Rule 18a](#rule-18a)) with which the
name is permanently associated. For taxa above the rank of species, the type is
one of the subordinate taxa, with which the name is permanently associated.
Formation of names of the taxa above the level of genus is based on the names of
the types, allowing tracing which biological entity is included in the taxon.
The nomenclatural type is not necessarily the most typical or representative
element of the taxon.

Types of the various taxonomic categories are presented in [Table 2](#table-2).

###### <a name="table-2"></a> Table 2. Nomenclatural types of taxonomic ranks

| Taxonomic category | Nomenclatural type
|--------------------|------------------------
| Subspecies         | Designated DNA sequence
| Species            | Designated DNA sequence
| Genus              | Designated species
| Family             | Designated genus
| Order              | Designated genus
| Class              | Designated genus
| Phylum             | Designated genus

##### Rule 17

The type of a taxon must be designated for the name to be validly published
(see [Section 5](#section-5)).

##### Rule 18a

The type of a species or subspecies is a designated DNA sequence that is
compliant with the minimum standards designated by the SeqCode Committee for
genome, metagenome-assembled genome, or single-amplified genome sequences.
The sequence must be available in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration (INSDC).
Upon recommendations of the SeqCode Committee or subcommittees on the taxonomy
of specific groups, the SeqCode Committee may approve other minimal standards as
suitable types for specific groups.

##### Rule 18b

The type of a species or subspecies must allow the unambiguous identification of
the taxon.
Names based on types that later prove to be ambiguous are not legitimate unless
a neotype is proposed.

##### Rule 18c

If the type of a name is lost or demonstrated to be ambiguous, a neotype
sequence may be proposed to the SeqCode Reconciliation Commission. If approved,
the SeqCode Registry will be amended to reflect the new type.

##### Rule 19

Unless designated under the rules of this code, a reference DNA sequence is not
a type but a sequence used in comparative studies. A reference sequence has no
standing in nomenclature.

##### Recommendation 19

When a strain belonging to a taxon named under the SeqCode is isolated,
a reference strain should be designated and submitted to two culture
collections in different countries.
Reference strains have no standing in nomenclature.

#### Types of higher taxa

##### Rule 20

Only taxa with legitimate names may serve as types for taxa higher than the rank
of species.

##### Rule 21a

The nomenclatural type of a genus is the type species that was designated when
the genus name was originally validly published.

##### Rule 21b

The valid publication of a new genus name as a deliberate substitute for an
earlier name found to be illegitimate does not change the type species of the
genus.

##### Rule 22

When more than one subordinate taxa are available to serve as type, the earliest
legitimately named taxon available at the time must be chosen, except where the
type is neither a strain nor sequence data (i.e., taxa described from
illustrations under the ICNP).

### <a name="section-5"></a> Section 5. Priority and Valid Publication of Names

##### Rule 23a

Any taxon with a given circumscription, position, and rank can bear only one
correct name, the earliest name that is in accordance with the rules of SeqCode.

**Note 1.** In the case of a species epithet, [Rule 23a](#rule-23a) must be
applied independently of the genus name. Under most circumstances, the species
epithet remains the same on transfer of a species from one genus to another.
However, if the species epithet is currently in use in the name of another
species or subspecies in the genus to which the species is to be transferred, a
new name must be proposed for the transferred species.

**Note 2.** In the case of a subspecies, [Rule 23a](#rule-23a) must be applied
independently of the genus name and species epithet. The subspecies epithet
remains the same on transfer of a subspecies from one species to another unless
the subspecies epithet has been previously used as the name of another species
or subspecies in the genus to which the subspecies is to be transferred.

##### Rule 23b

The priority of a genus, species, or subspecies name is determined by the time
and date of its valid publication, i.e., when the registration of the name is
completed. For purposes of priority, only legitimate names are taken into
consideration.

##### Rule 23c

The priority of species and subspecies names will compete for priority with
names in any other code after January 1, 2022. If two names validly published
after 1 January 2022 compete for priority, priority is determined by the time
and date of valid publication, either under the rules of the SeqCode or other
nomenclatural codes. If both names are published at the same time and date,
priority will be decided by the SeqCode Reconciliation Committee.

##### Rule 23d

The priority date of names of taxa of rank higher than genus proposed after 1
January 2022 is the same as the priority date of the corresponding type genus
name unless there is a published *Candidatus* name for the taxon. In that case,
the date of publication of the *Candidatus* name establishes priority for the
*Candidatus* name upon validation unless there is an ICNP name validly published
for the same taxon before 1 January 2022, in which case the date of valid
publication of the ICNP name establishes priority. Validating existing
*Candidatus* higher taxa names requires validation of a type genus name with an
appropriate stem and the associated names for the subordinated higher taxonomic
ranks where appropriate. However, this protection of *Candidatus* names is lost
if the *Candidatus* name is not validated by 1 January, 2027. The priority date
for names published before 1 January 2022 is the same as their priority under
the ICNP. This rule is retroactive to 1 January, 2022.

**Note 1.** After 1 January 2027, it is strongly recommended that genus names
are proposed to preserve published *Candidatus* names for higher taxa, when
appropriate, to allow validation of existing *Candidatus* names.

##### Rule 23e

Legitimate names validly published under the ICNP remain legitimate in the
SeqCode even if there are differences in type designations.

#### Effective publication

##### Rule 24a

Effective publication under the SeqCode means that the name and evidence for the
taxon have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or book.

##### Rule 24b

When a name of a new taxon is published in a work written in a language other
than English, the author(s) should include a description in English in the
publication.

##### Rule 24c

The following are not accepted as forms of effective publication.

1. Communication of new names at a meeting, minutes of a meeting, or abstracts
   of papers presented at meetings.
2. Placing of names in listings or catalogues of collections.
3. Reports in ephemeral publications, newsletters, white papers, self-published
   papers, or non-scientific periodicals.
4. A published patent application or issued patent including the name.
5. A database containing names associated with a sequence or metadata.
6. Electronic material available in advance of publication (e.g., papers in
   press or preprints).

#### Valid and Invalid Publication and Registration of Names

##### Rule 25

The time and date of validation is the time and date of completion of the
registration in the SeqCode Registry.

##### Rule 26

A name of a new taxon, or a new combination for an existing taxon, is not
validly published unless the following criteria are met:

1. The name is effectively published under the rules of the SeqCode.
2. The name is registered in the SeqCode Registry, along with mandatory data
   fields listed below.
3. The type of the taxon is clearly designated. In the case of species or
   subspecies, the type sequence is deposited according to Rule 18a and the
   accession number cited.
4. The taxonomic rank is designated.
5. The derivation (etymology) of a new name (and if necessary of a new
   combination) is given wherein one or more distinguishable roots are
   identified. Roots can originate from any language in use or extinct (see also
   [Recommendation 9](#recommendation-9)).

**Note 1.** When a new species or a new combination results in the proposal of a
new genus, both the new genus name and the new species name or the new
combination must be validly published. Publication of the new species epithet or
new combination alone does not constitute valid publication of the new genus
name.

**Note 2.** When possible, authors are recommended to include the SeqCode
Registry identifier in the effective publication.

**Note 3.** If the information provided in the registration and the effective
publication differ, the registration is considered definitive.

##### Recommendation 26

It is recommended that the name, etymology, type information, and diagnosis of
the novel taxon should be clearly identifiable in a designated section of the
effective publication (i.e., the section termed the ‘protologue’ by some
microbial taxonomists). Authors are encouraged to provide additional information
describing the taxon, such as predicted or known physiological characteristics,
ecological data, location, and additional metadata. Authors are also encouraged
to submit metadata with the type sequence in one of the INSDC databases.

##### Rule 27

Placement of a species or subspecies epithet into a genus or species that is
illegitimate does not preclude the legitimacy of the species or subspecies
epithet.

### <a name="section-6"></a> Section 6. Citation of Authors and Names

#### Proposal and Subsequent Citation of the Name of a New Taxon

##### Recommendation 28

The effective publication should be cited with the name of a previously proposed
taxon. Correct citation of a name enables the date of publication, the
description, and the circumscription of the taxon to be found. For names
published under the SeqCode, the validly published name and date of valid
publication should be determined from the SeqCode Registry.

#### Proposal of a New Combination

##### Rule 29

When an author proposes transfer of a species to another genus, or a subspecies
to another species, then the author who makes the proposal should indicate the
formation of the new combination by the addition of the abbreviation
‘‘*comb. nov.*’’ (*combinatio nova*). This convention should be used when the
author retains the original species epithet in the new combination. However, if
an author is obliged to substitute a new species epithet as a result of
homonymy, the abbreviation ‘‘*nom. nov.*’’ (*nomen novum*) should be used. The
original name is referred to as the basonym and should be given, along with the
citation of the effective publication, in the description of the novel
combination.


#### Citation of the Name of a Taxon whose Circumscription Has Been Emended

##### Recommendation 30

If an alteration of a taxon modifies its circumscription, the author responsible
may be indicated by the addition to the author citation of the abbreviation
‘‘*emend.*’’ (*emendavit*) followed by the name of the author responsible for
the change. Only alterations that cause significant changes in the
circumscription warrant description as an emendation.

### <a name="section-7"></a> Section 7. Changes in Names of Taxa as a Result of Transference, Union, or Change in Rank

##### Rule 31

If the type of a taxon is excluded, a type must be designated for the remaining
members of the original taxon (see [Rule 17](#rule-17)), which must be given a
new name.

##### Rule 32

A change in the name of a taxon is not warranted by an alteration of the
diagnostic characters or the circumscription.

##### Rule 33

If a genus is divided into two or more genera, the genus name must be retained
for the genus that retains the type species.

#### Division of Species and Subspecies

##### Rule 34a

When a species is divided into two or more species, the species epithet of the
original species must be retained for the taxon that includes the type.

##### Rule 34b

When a species is divided into two or more subspecies, the species epithet of
the original species must be retained for the subspecies that includes the type.

**Note.** Although the species and subspecies epithets in the name of a type
subspecies are the same, they do not contravene Rule 9 because they are based on
the same type.

##### Rule 34c

When a subspecies is divided into two or more subspecies, the subspecies epithet
of the original subspecies must be retained for the subspecies that includes the
type.

#### Transfer of a Species to Another Genus

##### Rule 35a

When a species is transferred to another genus without any change of rank, the
species epithet must be retained unless it is already in use in the new genus.
In that case, a new species epithet must be chosen for the transferred species.
This rule avoids creation of a later homonym.

##### Rule 35b

Regardless of its priority, the transfer of species that is not the type of
another genus does not affect the type species or priority of the receiving
genus even if it involves union of the incoming species with the type species of
the receiving genus.

##### Rule 35c

When the name of a genus is changed, the epithets of the species within it must
be retained unless already in use (see Rule 29).

**Note 1.** Modification of the gender of the species epithet to accommodate the
gender of the new genus name is a minor orthographic variant and encouraged.

#### Union of Taxa of Equal Rank

##### Rule 36

When two or more taxa of the same rank are united, then the name and type of the
taxon is determined by following the rules of priority (see Section 5). In cases
of species and subspecies, if the names or epithets are of the same time and
date, the author who first unites the taxa has the right to choose one of them,
and their choice must be followed.

##### Rule 37

When several species are united under one species as subspecies, the subspecies
that includes the type of the species under whose name they are united
must be designated by the same epithet as the species name (see Rule 13c).

##### Rule 38

If two or more species of different genera are united to form a single genus,
and if those species include the type species of one or more genera, the genus
name must be the earliest validly published, legitimate name. If no type species
is placed in the genus, a new genus name must be proposed, and a type species
must be specified.

##### Rule 39

When two or more taxa of the same rank from family to class are brought together
under a taxon of higher rank, the higher-ranking taxon should derive its name
from the name of the earliest legitimate type genus among the lower-ranking
taxa.

##### Rule 40

If no type genera were placed in the taxon, a new name based on the selected
type must be proposed (see [Rule 22](#rule-22)).

#### Change in Rank

##### Rule 41a

When the rank of a taxon of genus or above is changed, the stem of the name must
be retained and only the suffix altered (see Rule 15).

##### Rule 41b

When a subspecies is elevated in rank to a species, the subspecies epithet must
be used as the species epithet unless the resulting combination is illegitimate.

##### Rule 41c

When a species is lowered in rank to a subspecies, the species epithet must be
used as the subspecies epithet unless the resulting combination is illegitimate.

### <a name="section-8"></a> Section 8. Illegitimate Names and Epithets: Replacement, Rejection, and Conservation of Names and Epithets

#### Illegitimate Names

##### Rule 42

A name contrary to a rule is illegitimate and must not be used. However, a name
of a taxon that is illegitimate when the taxon is in one taxonomic position is
not necessarily illegitimate when the taxon is in another taxonomic position.

**Note.** Some common reasons for which a name may be illegitimate are the
following.

1. If the taxon to which the name was applied, as circumscribed by the author,
   included the nomenclatural type of a name which the author ought to have
   adopted under one or more of the rules.
2. If the author did not adopt for a binary or ternary combination the earliest
   legitimate genus name, species epithet, or subspecies epithet available for
   the taxon with its particular circumscription, position, and rank.
3. A species or subspecies epithet is illegitimate if it duplicates a species or
   subspecies epithet previously validly published for the same genus but whose
   name is based upon another type.

#### Replacement of Names

##### Rule 43

An illegitimate name or epithet should be replaced by the earliest legitimate
name or epithet in a binary or ternary combination which in the new position
will be in accordance with the rules. If no legitimate name or epithet exists,
one must be chosen. Since a species epithet is not rendered illegitimate by
publication in a species name in which the generic name is illegitimate, authors
may use such an epithet if they wish provided that there is no obstacle to its
employment in the new position or sense; the resultant combination is treated as
a new name (*nom. nov.*) and is ascribed to the author. The epithet is, however,
ascribed to the original author.

##### Rule 44

A legitimate name or epithet may not be replaced.

##### Rule 45

Names contrary to the General Considerations or Principles of the code may be
rejected by the SeqCode Reconciliation Comission.

### <a name="section-9"></a>Section 9. Orthography

##### Rule 46

All names comprise only the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet.
Diacritic signs are not to be used.

##### Rule 47

Any name or epithet should be written in conformity with the spelling of the
word from which it is derived and in accordance with the rules of Latin grammar.
Exceptions are provided for typographical and orthographic errors and
orthographic variants.

**Note 1.** Consult Appendix 9 of the ICNP for recommendations on forming
properly Latinized names.

**Note 2.** In the SeqCode an orthographic variant is a name (or epithet)
applied to the same type that differs from another name only in transliteration
into Latin of the same word from a language other than Latin or in its
grammatical correctness. Changes in suffixes for consistency with the names of
higher taxa are orthographic variants. Names transliterated from the same word
and based on different types are not orthographic variants.

#### Typographic and Orthographic Errors

##### Rule 48

The original spelling of a name or epithet must be retained, except for
typographical or orthographic errors.

An unintentional typographical or orthographic error in an effectively published
name may be corrected before or after validation in the Registry by the author
or the SeqCode Registry curators. The name is to be accepted in its corrected
form without affecting the status and date of valid publication. It can also be
corrected by a subsequent author in a peer-reviewed publication. That
publication may or may not mention that the spelling is corrected. In that case,
the authors or SeqCode Registry curators must update the name in the SeqCode
Registry. The abbreviation “corrig.” (*corrigendum*) may be appended to the name
if an author wishes to draw attention to the correction. Succeeding authors may
be unaware that the original usage was incorrect and use the spelling of the
original author(s). Other succeeding authors may follow the correction of a
previous author or may independently correct the spelling themselves, but in no
case is the use of corrig. regarded as obligatory. None of these corrections
affects the status and date of validation.

**Note 1.** The liberty of correcting a name or epithet must be used with
reserve, especially if the change affects the first syllable and above all the
first letter of the name or epithet.

**Note 2.** When feasible, as a courtesy, the SeqCode Registry curators will
inform one or more authors of the effective publication that typographical or
orthographic errors have been corrected in the Registry.

#### Personal Names

##### Rule 49

The genitive and adjectival forms of a personal name are treated as different
epithets and not as orthographic variants unless they are so similar as to cause
confusion.

#### Gender of Names

##### Rule 50

The gender of genus names is governed by the following.

1. A Latin or Latinized genus name retains the gender of its language of origin.
   Authors must give the gender of any proposed genus name. In cases where the
   classical gender varies, the author has the right of choice between the
   alternatives.
2. Genus names that are compounds from two or more Latin words take the gender
   of the last component of the compound word.
3. Arbitrarily formed genus names or vernacular names used as genus names take
   the gender assigned to them by their authors.



## <a name="chapter-4"></a> CHAPTER 4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS

When it is desirable to distinguish the nature of the type of a name, the
following convention is recommended. When the type for a species or subspecies
is determined by the ICNP, the superscript “T” will be used immediately
following the name or strain identifier. If the type is determined by the
SeqCode, the superscript “Ts” or “TS” will be used. When the type is a taxon at
the rank of genus or higher, the superscript is determined by the nature of the
type of the species. If superscripts are not possible, they may be replaced by
the symbols in parentheses, i.e., (T), (Ts), or (TS).

For the purpose of identification in the text, names of taxa at all ranks should
be italicized.

# APPENDIX I

Data quality and reporting requirements and recommendations for an isolate
genome, metagenome assembled genome (MAG), or single amplified genome (SAG) to
serve as the nomenclatural type for a species named under the SeqCode.
Requirements will be checked as part of the validation process on the SeqCode
Registry.
Recommendations are suggested best practices to guide authors and peer reviewers
to ensure high quality data supporting species to be named.

### To be included in publication proposing new species names under SeqCode

**Required**

* Name

**Recommended**

* Etymology
* Name formed with mnemonic cues
* Interpretation of biological properties inferred or demonstrated physiological
  traits and ecological information, such as habitat, in the manuscript body
  and/or protologue.
* Designated genome assembly (e.g., INSDC accession) and access to raw data
  (e.g., SRA accession).
* Include as much metadata as possible
  (see [Field et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnbt1360)).
* Provide evidence of the species, taxonomic rank, and position including the
  uniqueness of the species with respect to existing named species and justify
  the taxonomic rank and position
  (e.g., [Jain et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07641-9),
  [Karthikeyan et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-019-0400-5),
  [Parks et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0501-8),
  [Rodriguez-R et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky467)).
* For MAGs and SAGs, compare multiple high-quality genomes representing the
  species in more than one sample
  (e.g., Supplemental Information).<sup>a</sup><br/>
  **Rationale:** Initial requirements encourage wide participation from many
  microbiological disciplines and enable validation of names published prior to
  the SeqCode.
  Critical data will be captured in the SeqCode Registry in any case.
  Some recommendations could become requirements in the future.

### Data quality necessary for completion of SeqCode Registry<sup>b</sup>

**Required**

* Type genome assembly quality for MAGs and SAGs:
  &gt;90% complete and &lt;5% contaminated
  (modified from [Bowers et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3893)).
  For isolates, read coverage &ge;10x
  ([Field et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt1360)).
* Agreement between genome and 16S rRNA taxonomic assignments

**Recommended**

* 16S rRNA genes &gt;75% complete and passes chimera checks
  &gt;80% of tRNAs present
  (modified from [Bowers et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3893)).
* High genome integrity
  (contig # &lt;100; N50 &gt;25 kb; max. contig &gt;100 kb).
* MAG/SAG read coverage &ge;10x.

### Data availability required for SeqCode Registry

* Assembly available in INSDC databases
* Raw data available in INSDC databases
  (e.g., Sequence Read Archive)<sup>c</sup><br/>
  **Rationale:** Registry queries the INSDC databases to perform automatic
  checks of data quality



**a.** Comparison of multiple high-quality genomic assemblies from
multiple samples can support the non-chimeric nature of MAGs and provide
confidence of the assembly for both MAGs and SAGs.

**b.** Data quality will be assessed by automated pipelines or other approaches.
Exceptions for lower data quality should be justified by authors in the
effective publication.

**c.** Not required for names effectively published before January 1, 2023, to
allow for existing published names (e.g., existing *Candidatus* names) and names
currently undergoing peer review to be validated under the SeqCode.
